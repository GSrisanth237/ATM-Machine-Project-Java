ATM Simulation System – Java (OOP Project)

A console-based ATM Simulation System built using Core Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
This project demonstrates Encapsulation, Interfaces, Classes, Collections, and real-life ATM operations through a simple user interface.

🔹 How the System Works

1. User enters ATM Number & PIN.


2. If authenticated, user can:

View Balance

Deposit Cash

Withdraw Cash

View Mini Statement



3. System logs each transaction using a HashMap.


4. Clean exit from the system.

🔹 Sample Output

WELCOME TO ATM MACHINE
ENTER THE ATM NUMBER: 123456
ENTER THE ATM PIN: 123

1. View Balance
2. Withdraw Amount
3. Deposit Amount
4. View Mini Statement
5. Exit
